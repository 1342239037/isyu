# A Deep Neural Network for Predicting Synergistic Drug Combinations on Cancer

This code repository is the supporting material in the paper. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DconnC, which leverages the integration of chemical structure data and gene expression data to predict the synergistic effects of drug combinations.

## Requirements


```bash
conda create -n DconnC python=3.7
conda activate DconnC
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c dglteam/label/cu117 dgl
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit==2018.09.3
pip install dgllife
```

## Data preparation

All data used in this paper are public and accessible. The relevant dataset has been stored in [Cloud Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mgCB3NJJB4RXE_KrxmdlQK7_LXtU66kh?usp=sharing) and can be downloaded to the `./data/raw/` folder. Please refer to the [DATA README](./data/raw/README.md) for the source of each file.

After downloading the relevant dataset and place it in the `./data/raw/` folder you can generate the training set and test set by running

```bash
python data_pre.py
```

## Training

After generating the traning set and test set `(ONEIL_train.pkl„ÄÅONEIL_test.pkl)` you can start training the model by running

```bash
python main.py
```
